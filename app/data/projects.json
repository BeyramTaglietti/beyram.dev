    "description": "Norse Venture is a project which crossed my mind when I needed a cool and complete way to organize a trip among my friends and found nothing that 100% satisfied my needs. It helps you by inserting the tasks you want to do on a certain trip (plus specific task infos such as location, description, available times and more), thus making sure you'll never miss anything you wanted to do. Used to be a web application, it is now a mobile application (currently only available on IOS)",
